      <p>Welcome to the forum for the Global Space Balloon Challenge! This forum is the crux of the GSBC community - introduce your team, share your ideas, ask questions, and help others successfully fly their balloons. Anything and everything about HABs is welcome. Be nice and follow the rules for your forum behavior, but please make this forum your own.</p>

<h2>What is This Forum About?</h2>

<p>The Global Space Balloon Challenge (GSBC) is the coming together of people around the world to simultaneously fly <a href="https://balloonchallenge.org/what-is-a-hab">high altitude balloons</a> from every corner of the globe, celebrating an age where anyone can reach the edge of space for a few hundred dollars and a few weekends of work. <a href="https://balloonchallenge.org/">Learn more</a> and <a href="https://balloonchallenge.org/login">join the fun</a> on our website or check out the hundreds of teams from dozens of countries <a href="https://balloonchallenge.org/teams">already signed up</a>!</p>

<p>On this forum, get the help you need for your HAB from the <a href="https://community.balloonchallenge.org/c/tutorials">“tutorials”</a> and <a href="https://community.balloonchallenge.org/c/technical-q-a">“technical Q&amp;A”</a> categories. Let us know when you are flying throughout the year and what happens through the <a href="https://community.balloonchallenge.org/c/launch-announcements-and-results">“launch announcements and results”</a> category so everyone can see your progress! Educators head to the <a href="https://community.balloonchallenge.org/c/education">“education”</a> category and if you need anything else or want to share something awesome, check out <a href="https://community.balloonchallenge.org/c/sharing">“general questions and sharing”</a> [link]. For all GSBC information, we’ll be posting to <a href="https://community.balloonchallenge.org/c/challenges-and-previous-results">“challenges and previous results”</a> for prize info and results from last year and to <a href="https://community.balloonchallenge.org/c/gsbc-announcements">“GSBC announcements”</a> for nearly everything else challenge related.</p>

<h2>Requirements for Participation in the GSBC</h2>

<p>Anyone participating in the Global Space Balloon Challenge must follow these requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You must be part of a team with at least one other member. This is to ensure everyone’s safety as they assemble and fly their balloons.</p></li>
<li><p>Your payload must contain a camera. We know this adds weight to your balloon, but we believe sharing photos is the best way to inspire and connect with other teams, a critical component of the GSBC.</p></li>
<li><p>Your payload must carry a GPS. This will allow you to track and recover your payload safely.</p></li>
<li><p>You must follow all your local regulations. Please see<a href="https://balloonchallenge.org/regulations"> the regulations page</a> for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenge submissions must be submitted by no more than 1 week after the challenge window has closed.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone on a team must have signed up on the website and accepted the <a href="https://balloonchallenge.org/terms_and_conditions.pdf">Terms and Conditions.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Before Creating New Help Topics, Please...</h2>

<p>Make sure that you take a look around before just starting a new topic - there's a good chance that somebody else has already asked the same question.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Please search before opening a new topic</strong>, as someone might have<br>already created the topic you want to open. Note that we do search on<br>your behalf as you compose a new topic, too.</p></li>
<li><p>When creating a topic, <strong>be sure to select the correct category</strong> so it<br>is easier to find. It is OK to leave category blank if none feel<br>applicable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure to be very descriptive in your topic</strong>, and give it an<br>accurate title. If you just post "my balloon doesn't work", we can't and<br>won't help.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Things to Avoid Doing</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Do not post affiliate links in posts.</strong> Nobody else will appreciate<br>them, and you will be flagged by other users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Please do not spam us with your web site link.</strong> Nobody appreciates<br>people who sign up and then spam their software immediately without<br>contributing. There are some exceptions, but you should first email<br>us to ask if you can.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Please do not act like a troll.</strong> People posting nonsense, demonstrably<br>false statements, propaganda, or inflaming other people repeatedly<br>for no reason will be warned and then banned. This is meant to be a<br>civil discussion area.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Please do not post other people's work or information as your own.</strong> Cite properly. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree</h2>

<p>You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But, remember to <em>criticize ideas, not people</em>. Please avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name-calling.</li>
<li>Ad hominem attacks.</li>
<li>Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.</li>
<li>Knee-jerk contradiction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation. Be clear and concise.</p>

<h2>Your Participation Counts</h2>

<p>The conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.</p>

<p>Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: favorites, bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.</p>

<h2>If You See a Problem, Flag It</h2>

<p>Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.</p>

<p>When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. <em>Just flag it</em>. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.</p>

<p>In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.</p>

<h2>Keep It Tidy</h2>

<p>Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.</li>
<li>Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.</li>
<li>Don’t post no-content replies.</li>
<li>Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a New Topic.</p>

<h2>Terms of Service</h2>

<p>Yes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves – and by extension, you and your data – against unfriendly folks. We have a <a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/tos">Terms of Service</a> describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content, privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by our <a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/tos">TOS</a>.</p>

<p>Most met balloons have published data that specifies their performance for a particular set of conditions: free lift, ascent rate, burst height &amp; payload weight - but the balloons are quite capable of handling other sets of conditions - the manufacturers just don't specify what the results will be.  Typically balloons up to 1000g have specifications for a payload weight of 250g and above that for 1050g.  This is where your 1050g figure came from.</p>

<p>The calculator at the bottom of this page:</p>

<p><a href="http://randomaerospace.com/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://randomaerospace.com/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="469 clicks">469</span></a></p>

<p>and here</p>

<p><a href="http://habhub.org/calc/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://habhub.org/calc/<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="236 clicks">236</span></a></p>

<p>allows you to try different balloon size, gas type, payload weight &amp; ascent rate combinations - it gives a reasonable <strong>estimate</strong> of gas volume needed, expected burst height, neck lift etc.  </p>

<p>For example yesterday I launched 1.4Kg in payloads under a small 350g totex balloon. That balloon only has published data for a 250g payload and at a much lower free lift than we were using.  The resultant ascent rate and burst altitude were very close to the estimated values (estimated average ascent rate 6m/sec, actual 6.1m/sec, estimated burst 18Km actual 19.2Km).</p>

<p>Obviously if you have a heavy payload on a small balloon and/or you fill it with a lot of gas (to get a fast ascent)  it wont get very high before it bursts.  So how far can you push it?  That would depend on the balloon construction, make, size and type.   Personally as a rule of thumb I wouldn't normally go for more than about 2 times the balloon weight.</p>

<p>A Totex TA-1500, Hwoyee 1600 or Pawan 2000 would probably be a good choice for that sort of payload weight - but ask around and see what has worked for others.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Balloons:</strong> I would generally avoid using more than one balloon unless you have a reliable release mechanism - one of the balloons is liable to burst first and the result might be a "float" or a very gradual descent to the ground over several hours.  </p>

<p>Finally, and I don't want to sound pompous - but it sounds like your new to this - are you really sure you want to launch a 2.5Kg payload on your first flight? - my recommendation would be to start with something much lighter.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls clearfix"><div class="actions"><button aria-label="share a link to this post" title="share a link to this post" data-share-url="/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/2" data-post-number="2" class="widget-button"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></div></nav></section></div><section class="post-actions"></section></div><div class="gutter"><ul class="post-links"></ul></div></div></article></div><div class="topic-post clearfix regular"><article id="post_3" data-post-id="599" data-user-id="9" class="boxed onscreen-post"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203" class="tabLoc"></a><div class="row"><div class="topic-avatar"><a class="trigger-user-card main-avatar" href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/users/AnthonyS" data-user-card="AnthonyS"><img alt="" width="45" height="45" src="./Payload 2.5kg, which balloon should we use_ - Technical Q&amp;A - Discourse_files/12_1(1).png" title="AnthonyS" class="avatar"></a><div class="poster-avatar-extra"></div></div><div class="topic-body"><div class="topic-meta-data"><div class="names trigger-user-card"><span class="username"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/users/AnthonyS" data-auto-route="true" data-user-card="AnthonyS">AnthonyS</a></span></div><div class="post-info"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/3" data-share-url="/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/3" data-post-number="3" class="post-date"><span title="March 8, 2015 6:33pm" data-time="1425854013085" data-format="tiny" class="relative-date">Mar '15</span></a></div><div class="read-state read" title="Post is unread"><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></div></div><div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>I would concur with Steve 2.5kg is very heavy.

Be careful launching a balloon inflated to that amount - excess force during launch (due for example to wind pull on the neck) could burst the balloon - try for a nice graceful release.

<p>I recommend you try launching with a smaller payload first - so you can experience the process before trying with a 2.5Kg payload and 5Kg of neck lift.</p>

Thanks.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls clearfix"><div class="actions"><button aria-label="share a link to this post" title="share a link to this post" data-share-url="/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/8" data-post-number="8" class="widget-button"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></div></nav></section></div><section class="post-actions"></section></div><div class="gutter"><ul class="post-links"></ul></div></div></article></div><div class="topic-post clearfix regular"><article id="post_9" data-post-id="651" data-user-id="93" class="boxed onscreen-post"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203" class="tabLoc"></a><div class="row"><div class="topic-avatar"><a class="trigger-user-card main-avatar" href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/users/RandomAerospace" data-user-card="RandomAerospace"><img alt="" width="45" height="45" src="./Payload 2.5kg, which balloon should we use_ - Technical Q&amp;A - Discourse_files/159_1(1).png" title="RandomAerospace" class="avatar"></a><div class="poster-avatar-extra"></div></div><div class="topic-body"><div class="topic-meta-data"><div class="names trigger-user-card"><span class="username"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/users/RandomAerospace" data-auto-route="true" data-user-card="RandomAerospace">RandomAerospace</a></span></div><div class="post-info"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/9" data-share-url="/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/9" data-post-number="9" class="post-date"><span title="March 11, 2015 9:59am" data-time="1426082356464" data-format="tiny" class="relative-date">Mar '15</span></a></div><div class="post-info edits"><a title="post last edited on March 11, 2015 11:16am">1 <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div><div class="read-state read" title="Post is unread"><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></div></div><div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>The simplest way to measure how much gas is in the balloon is to measure the neck lift with weights  - tie on the neck lift weight given in the calculator and when you have put in enough gas the weights will lift off the ground (continuously). <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/16828840@N07/8395853605/" rel="nofollow">https://www.flickr.com/photos/16828840@N07/8395853605/<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="47 clicks">47</span></a> Don't forget to allow for the weight of the filling tube. The calculator has allowed for the weight of the balloon in the neck lift calculation.</p>

<p>There is a calculation that links an estimate of gas needed, neck lift and burst height.  given the balloon size, gas, payload weight and ascent rate - its embedded in the online calculator.  Its not a straightforward formula - but rather based on an iterative solution process.  </p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls clearfix"><div class="actions"><button aria-label="share a link to this post" title="share a link to this post" data-share-url="/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/9" data-post-number="9" class="widget-button"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></div></nav></section></div><section class="post-actions"></section></div><div class="gutter"><ul class="post-links"></ul></div></div></article></div><div class="time-gap small-action clearfix"><div class="topic-avatar"><i class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></div><div class="small-action-desc">1 year later</div></div><div class="topic-post clearfix regular"><article id="post_10" data-post-id="1980" data-user-id="124" class="boxed onscreen-post"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203" class="tabLoc"></a><div class="row"><div class="topic-avatar"><a class="trigger-user-card main-avatar" href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/users/rstriemer" data-user-card="rstriemer"><img alt="" width="45" height="45" src="./Payload 2.5kg, which balloon should we use_ - Technical Q&amp;A - Discourse_files/231_1(1).png" title="rstriemer" class="avatar"></a><div class="poster-avatar-extra"></div></div><div class="topic-body"><div class="topic-meta-data"><div class="names trigger-user-card"><span class="username"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/users/rstriemer" data-auto-route="true" data-user-card="rstriemer">rstriemer</a></span></div><div class="post-info"><a href="http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/10" data-share-url="/t/payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use/203/10" data-post-number="10" class="post-date"><span title="May 3, 2016 4:28pm" data-time="1462307330147" data-format="tiny" class="relative-date">May '16</span></a></div><div class="read-state read" title="Post is unread"><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></div></div><div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>I recommend you consult the air regulations for your jurisdiction. Your mass is much greater than we can get away with in Canada. Also tethering balloons is prohibited in Canada for various reasons like increasing the chance of snaring important infrastructure, other aircraft... Also check the rules about launching aircraft from your balloon.</p>

<p>I think the best option is to reduce the mass of your payload and read the air regs as it applies to unmanned balloons.</p>

Typically balloons up to 1000g have specifications for a payload weight of 250g and above that for 1050g.  This is where your 1050g figure came from.<\/p>\n\n<p>The calculator at the bottom of this page:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://randomaerospace.com/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://randomaerospace.com/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>and here<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://habhub.org/calc/\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://habhub.org/calc/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>allows you to try different balloon size, gas type, payload weight &amp; ascent rate combinations - it gives a reasonable <strong>estimate<\/strong> of gas volume needed, expected burst height, neck lift etc.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For example yesterday I launched 1.4Kg in payloads under a small 350g totex balloon. That balloon only has published data for a 250g payload and at a much lower free lift than we were using.  The resultant ascent rate and burst altitude were very close to the estimated values (estimated average ascent rate 6m/sec, actual 6.1m/sec, estimated burst 18Km actual 19.2Km).<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously if you have a heavy payload on a small balloon and/or you fill it with a lot of gas (to get a fast ascent)  it wont get very high before it bursts.  So how far can you push it?  That would depend on the balloon construction, make, size and type.   Personally as a rule of thumb I wouldn't normally go for more than about 2 times the balloon weight.<\/p>\n\n<p>A Totex TA-1500, Hwoyee 1600 or Pawan 2000 would probably be a good choice for that sort of payload weight - but ask around and see what has worked for others.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiple Balloons:<\/strong> I would generally avoid using more than one balloon unless you have a reliable release mechanism - one of the balloons is liable to burst first and the result might be a \"float\" or a very gradual descent to the ground over several hours.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, and I don't want to sound pompous - but it sounds like your new to this - are you really sure you want to launch a 2.5Kg payload on your first flight? - my recommendation would be to start with something much lighter.<\/p>","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2015-03-08T14:10:39.267Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"avg_time":57,"incoming_link_count":67,"reads":51,"score":93.05,"yours":false,"topic_id":203,"topic_slug":"payload-2-5kg-which-balloon-should-we-use","display_username":"Steve","primary_group_name":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://randomaerospace.com/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Balloons","clicks":469},{"url":"http://habhub.org/calc/","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"habitat burst calculator","clicks":236}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":93,"hidden":false,"hidden_reason_id":null,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":"","can_view_edit_history":false,"wiki":false},{"id":599,"name":"Anthony Stirk / Uputronics","username":"AnthonyS","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/community.balloonchallenge.org/anthonys/{size}/12_1.png","created_at":"2015-03-08T22:33:33.085Z","cooked":"<p>I would concur with Steve 2.5kg is very heavy.
